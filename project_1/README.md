This program will manage the quiz scores for a class of 3 students. All students will have the same number of
quiz scores and it will be specified by the user. The program should prompt the user to enter the name of each
student as well as the quiz scores for each student.

It should then present the user with a menu system, which shows a set of possible choices:
1. Calculate Class Average
2. Calculate Student Average
3. Calculate Quiz Average
The program should prompt the user to enter a number corresponding to one of the choices, or the letter x to
exit. As long as the user doesn’t press x, the program should continue to show the menu to the user.

                                LIBRARY LIST 
An area library is considering letting patrons checkout electronic devices such as tablets and eReaders. It is
therefore commissioning a prototype of a Device Management and Checkout System (DMCS) by a group of
talented CIS developers studying Object-Oriented Design/Programming!

For its management purposes, the library would like the following. A main menu should present the user with
options. Users should be able to see a list of devices, add a new device, edit an existing device, search for a
device by name, and check out a device. The main menu should ask which option the user would like to select
and perform that action. After completion, the user should be brought back to the main menu. The main
menu should also allow users to cleanly exit the application. Also, needless to say, the library would prefer if
its application did not crash! That would be a bad result for the development team
